# 📐 Drafting Management System (DMS)

The **Drafting Management System (DMS)** was built to solve workflow inefficiencies in the Nashua Builders drafting department. The goal was to give drafters and managers a smarter, faster way to manage tasks, track deadlines, and access key project information — all in one place.

## 🧭 Overview

Designed with a user-first approach, DMS includes:

* 🎨 **Color-Coded Task Board** – Visual priority and timeline tracking
* 🔄 **Real-Time Update Log** – Clear visibility into progress and changes
* 📚 **Interactive Information Hub** – Tutorials, drafting standards, and reference links
* 👨‍💼 **Manager View** – Streamlined oversight of packet reviews and completions

This system improved transparency, accountability, and team productivity.

## 🎯 Key Features

* ✅ Toggle-based task tracking for every page type in a drafting packet
* 📅 Dual-layer due date system for reviews and final deadlines
* 🤖 Smart automation for due dates and packet state detection
* 📘 Centralized hub for standards, tutorials, and resources
* 📝 Real-time log for change tracking and communication

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **AppSheet**
* **Google Sheets**
* **Google Workspace** (Docs, Slides, Drive)

## 📊 Results

* 📦 **Missing packets** reduced to **0%**
* ⏱️ **Late packets** dropped to **<1%**
* 🚀 Faster issue resolution through better task visibility
* 📘 Easier onboarding with built-in training materials
* 🛠️ Continuous improvements based on live user feedback

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated

* **Process Automation** – Automated due dates and task states
* **UI/UX Design** – Clean, color-coded interface
* **Project Management** – Iterative development with user input
* **Workflow Optimization** – Reduced errors and delays
* **Technical Communication** – Built a self-serve info hub
* **Cross-Team Collaboration** – Worked with both drafters and managers

## 🤝 Collaboration

* Met with drafting team and managers to define requirements
* Identified workflow pain points and feature priorities
* Maintained feedback loops for continuous improvement

## 🖼️ Before & After

| **Before**                                        | **After**                                                                        |

| Unstructured data, no timelines, manual searching | Filtered task board with due dates, instant visibility, and color-coded statuses |

## 🪞 Reflections

* 🚧 **Limitation**: AppSheet’s 10-user cap limited communication scalability
* 🧠 **What I Learned**: Deepened my understanding of AppSheet’s strengths/limits
* 🔧 **Next Steps**: Rebuild with a custom-coded solution for full flexibility and scale
